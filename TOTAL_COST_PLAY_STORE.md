## 🎯 Break-Even Analysis with Play Store

### Costs to Cover:
```
Fixed costs: $50/month (hosting + minimum services)
Variable per user: $0.31/month (operational)
Play Store takes: 18% of revenue

Break-even formula:
Revenue per user × (1 - 0.18) - $0.31 = $50 / users

At $4.99/month:
$4.99 × 0.82 = $4.09 net per user
$4.09 - $0.31 = $3.78 profit per user

Break-even: $50 ÷ $3.78 = 14 users
```

**You need only 14 paying users to break even!**
