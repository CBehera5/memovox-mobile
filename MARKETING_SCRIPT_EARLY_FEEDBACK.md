# 🎙️ MemoVox - Early Feedback Marketing Script

## 📱 Quick Pitch (30 seconds)

---

### Version 1: Casual Friend Message

```
Hey! 👋

I just built something cool and would love your feedback!

It's called MemoVox - an AI voice assistant that turns your voice into organized tasks.

Instead of typing everything, you just:
1. 🎙️ Talk (record your thoughts)
2. 🤖 AI transcribes & analyzes it
3. ✅ Tasks are created automatically

Plus, you can chat with an AI assistant (like having JARVIS from Iron Man! 😎)

Would you be willing to test it out and give me honest feedback? Takes 5 mins!

### Version 2: Professional Network

```
Hi [Name],

I've developed MemoVox - an AI-powered voice assistant app for productivity, and I'm looking for early feedback from people I trust.

What it does:
• Converts voice recordings into organized tasks
• Uses AI to automatically extract reminders, events, and priorities
• Includes an intelligent chat assistant for task management

Perfect for busy professionals who think faster than they type.

Would you have 10 minutes to try it out? Your feedback would be invaluable at this stage.

Thanks!

### Version 4: Email to Friends/Family

**Subject:** Need Your Help Testing My New App! 🎙️

```
Hi [Name],

I've been working on something exciting and would really appreciate your feedback!

I built MemoVox - it's like having a personal AI assistant in your pocket. 

Here's the magic:
Instead of typing out your to-dos, you just talk to your phone. The AI listens, transcribes everything, and automatically creates tasks with priorities and due dates.

Think of it like this:
❌ Old way: Type "Meeting with John tomorrow at 2pm, need to prepare presentation"
✅ New way: Just say it out loud → AI creates the task → Done! 

Plus, you can chat with the AI assistant (I named him JARVIS 😊) and ask things like "What's my most urgent task?" or "Remind me what I said about that project."

Could you:
1. Download and try it for a few days
2. Record a few voice memos
3. Tell me what you love/hate/would change

Be brutally honest - I need real feedback to make this better!

Thanks so much!

P.S. - It's completely free for now, no strings attached!
